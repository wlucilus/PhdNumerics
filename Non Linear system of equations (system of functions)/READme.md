# Description

Numerically calculates the unknown functions in a system of the type  
$$f(x) = G(n(x), x)$$    
$$g(x) = H(f(x), x)$$  

Returning the numerical values of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in the $x$ domain  

The algorithm uses a 2D Newton method and a matrix diagonalization algorithm (LDA decomposition)
